# The why's

In the Scala space for the longest time Akka was the prominent toolkit for implementing many important patterns and solutions for various use cases.
One of the most prominent and synonymous in Scala is [Event Sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) implemented via [Akka-Persistence](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/persistence.html).

The recent changes in [Akka licensing](https://www.lightbend.com/blog/why-we-are-changing-the-license-for-akka), might be an impulse which will cause some developers to reconsider using Akka if they need to use Event Sourcing. There are obvious alternatives like [Axon](https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework) or [Endless4s](https://endless4s.github.io/).
Both solutions look great, but what if we want something native to ZIO.

Let's check how we could implement a simple Event sourcing solution with ZIO 2.0

### It's "simple"

The concept is pretty "simple", as it is modelling business entities as a journal of ordered, atomic changes which are folded into a single entity state.

This way we can rollback in time and see individual changes in the entity, replay events if we there is a use case(like Analytics).

#### Why Akka is special here?

Akka is use in production for many years and solved many operation issues, lets try to tackle couple of them like:

##### Passivation

Passivation allows to shutdown and clean up the entity from memory if its not needed, when there is a need to interact with it, it will be reloaded.

##### Snapshotting

At some point an entity can have millions of events, reloading this amount of events might be unfeasible, hence we can use snapshotting to capture a state of an entity from a recent time, omitting older events.

We can for example combine those 2 features i.e. make a snapshot on passivation, to be able to load the entity with just getting the last snapshot.

# Brewing you own event sourced entity

As said, the entity is the aggregate of events, lets say we will use a `ZStream`

```scala

def handleEvent(state: State, event: Event): UIO[State] = ???

ZStream(evt1, evt2, evt3, ..., evtX).runFoldZIO(emptyState){
  case(state, event) => handleEvent(state, event)
}
```

This introduces the basic concept of with just using a `ZStream`

Ok, but lets say we want to make something more robust and extendable, lets model this from the API level and lets say we want to inspire ourselves with Akka-Persistence.

```scala
object MyPersistentBehavior {

  enum Command {
    case NextNumber(value: Long)
    case Clear
  }

  enum Event {
    case NextNumberAdded(value: Long)
    case Cleared
  }

  final case class State(numbers: List[Long] = Nil)

  def apply(id: String) =
    EventSourcedEntity[Command, Event, State](
      persistenceId = id,
      emptyState = State(),
      commandHandler = (state, cmd) => ???,
      eventHandler = (state, evt) => ???
    )
}
```

A keen eye can immediately notice the inspiration. We handle the provide the `persistenceId` the empty state and handlers for commands and events.

We just mentioned events, so where commands come from?

Well, commands are basically... commands issued from the outside world, if we want to Add a number to the list, clear the list, or get the current list of numbers, we would send a command to the entity.

These handlers we could model simple as 

```scala
commandHandler: (STATE, COMMAND) => URIO[Any, EVENT],
eventHandler: (STATE, EVENT) => URIO[Any, STATE]
```

Now we see that a commandHandlers uses the command and the current state to create an event.
While the eventHandler uses the event and current state to create a new state.

For now, lets say that only Events can update the STATE, and only Command can create an event.

```
COMMAND => EVENT => STATE
```

So what do we need to make a fully functional entity? And what ZIO gives us which can help?

*First* of, we need to store the current state. That is easy, we can use `Ref.Synchronized`.

```scala
currentState <- Ref.Synchronized.make(emptyState)
```

*Second*, we to load the existing event, if we have any. Here we need to introduce a new concept -> Journaling. We can model a journal in a simple way, using here before mentioned `ZStream`

```scala
trait Journal[EVENT] {
  def persist(id: String, event: EVENT): IO[Nothing, Unit]

  def load(id: String): ZStream[Any, Nothing, EVENT]
}
```

`load` creates a `ZStream` which provides the existing events, and `persist` persists the Event which might be a result of the command.

Now we need to go back and update our handlers to take those facts into consideration

```scala
commandHandler: (STATE, COMMAND) => URIO[Journal[EVENT], EVENT],
```

As now we need to be aware of the Journal, for which commandHandler will persist Events back to the Journal.

And calling the journal now is just calling `runFoldZIO` and updating the `Ref`

```scala
   def journalPlayback(
      journal: Journal[EVENT],
      currentState: Ref.Synchronized[State]
    ) =
      currentState.updateAndGetZIO { st =>
        journal
          .load(persistenceId)
          .runFoldZIO(st) { case (state, event) =>
            eventHandler(state, event)
          }
      }
```

*Third* is we need to capture incoming commands and create an event out of it.

We want to constantly react to command in a synchronous order.

For that we can use the ZIO `Queue`

```scala
commandQueue <- Queue.unbounded[COMMAND]
```

and consume the queue indefinitely

```scala
    def commandDispatch(
      queue: Queue[COMMAND],
      journal: Journal[EVENT],
      currentState: Ref.Synchronized[STATE]
    ) =
      currentState.updateAndGetZIO { state =>
        queue.take
          .flatMap(cmd => commandHandler(state, cmd))
          .flatMap(event => eventHandler(state, event))
      }.forever.fork

```

We create a `Fiber` which continuously updates the state with the created event.

And the last step, we create a handle for the outside world to interact with it

```scala
 yield new EntityRef[COMMAND, STATE] {
   override def state: UIO[STATE] = currentState.get.map(_._2)

   override def send(command: COMMAND): UIO[Unit] = commandQueue.offer(command).unit
 }
```

The `state` here is a bit against good practice but good for debugging our idea.

`send` takes in the command and passes it into the before mentioned command queue.

Now lets revisit our entity implementation to se how we can we implement the handlers

```scala
      commandHandler = (state, cmd) =>
        cmd match
          case Command.NextNumber(value) => ZIO.succeed(Event.NextNumberAdded(value))
          case Command.Clear             => ZIO.succeed(Event.Cleared)
      ,
      eventHandler = (state, evt) =>
        evt match
          case Event.NextNumberAdded(value) =>
            ZIO
              .succeed(state.copy(numbers = state.numbers :+ value))
          case Event.Cleared                => ZIO.succeed(State())
    )
}
```

And interacting with our entity

```scala
    for {
      entity  <- MyPersistentBehavior("test")
      _       <- ZIO.foreach(1 to 100)(n => entity.send(Command.NextNumber(n)))
      numbers <- entity.state
    } yield numbers
```

### Summarizing

We created basic of Event Souring with just couple of ZIOs and there is potential here for making this into an interesting alternative for Akka-Persistence.

### Drawbacks?

A lot.

It's obvious currently that creating 2 entities on the same machine will cause corruption of the journal.
This concern could be alleviated by [ShardCake](https://github.com/devsisters/shardcake) and using the PersistenceId as ShardId.

We still didn't do snapshots and passivation, I'm hoping to work on that next.

### Was it Simple?

So I keep saying its simple, but its not **easy**. The Lightbend team had years to perfect their solution based on their battle tested actor framework.
There is still remaining topics like event serialization, schema migration, error handling.
